### Why Should You Read This?

Excelling at your job is not a topic people talk about as much as other aspects of software engineering. I am writing this because when I joined my first software engineering team about four years ago, I had a lot of questions about what sort of things I needed to be aware of to conduct my work in the most professional manner while living a meaningful life, but the answers I got were limited to how vast my network was. Here I will be sharing exactly what I think would have been helpful to me while starting my first role.

1. ### Understanding What You Want to Achieve at the Company

Setting goals for what you want to achieve at the company would guide the level of dedication and energy you intend to put into the company. This cannot be underemphasised. If you're taking the job to get more experience, then it means you'd be curious about everything strange you come across and try to amass as much knowledge as possible, irrespective of the circumstances. 

If it's for money, then you definitely want to put in extra work, demonstrate a high level of ownership, and do several other things that would make the company identify you as a valuable asset, so when it's time for a performance review, it's evident you deserve a raise or bonus.

2. ### Take some time to rest before resuming

Interviews can be exhausting, especially when you interview with a lot of companies before you get your current job. It's always in your best interest to put your best foot forward and make a good first impression. But resuming exhausted and low on energy is not good for your mental health and the quality of work. If you're exhausted, ensure you're coming in refreshed by requesting some time before resuming unless the company cannot afford it at the moment, which nine out of ten times they can. Trust me, you'd thank yourself months down the line.

3. ### Meet and bond with the team.

Bonding with the team is a crucial aspect. You need to be able to read the room and identify which kind of team you are on and go with the flow. If you're on a team like mine that praises in public and criticizes in private, you don't want to do otherwise. If you can't figure it out on your own, ask around among colleagues. However, I believe most teams are open about their values.

4. ### Exercise Great Listening Skills And Ask Questions 

Listening and jotting them down works really well for me as it enables me to keep track of information. Ensure you capture as much as you can. If you're just joining a team, it's fine to question everything. "Yes!" I said it. Don't be scared to ask questions. Just make sure you can justify your reasons for asking. But rest assured that you're not expected to know everything within the first few weeks, so give yourself time for it all to sink in.

5. ### A high level of understanding of what the product does.

Most first timers try to go through all aspects of the codebase before starting out. I think what's more important is to understand what the product does from a user's perspective. Identify the critical parts of the application from the user's perspective. Once you understand this, the reasons for making technical decisions will start to make sense. Trust me, I have been working on several large and complex codebases for years, and there are several parts of the applications I have never explored or seen before.

6. ### Get the application to run on your local machine.

This is similar to the previous point highlighted above. Ensure you can start the application. This should be the first programming task you should do at your first job. But it depends on the company. The importance of doing this as soon as possible is to position you to be able to make contributions to the existing system as soon as possible. It's fine if you've not explored the full application. The more you contribute and work on tasks, the more you get familiar with the technical and non technical aspects of the product.

7. ### Clarify the scope of work and make sure you understand what you're working on.

One of the biggest mistakes any software engineer can make is not fully understanding what they're supposed to work on and proposing a fix. Because not only is it a waste of your time, but also the company's money. Try to make a conscious effort to understand before implementing. For me, sometimes I add comments that explain some of the technical details of how I want to implement a feature and send them to the person in charge of reviewing my ticket before making changes to the code. Also, while implementing a task, if I discover some edge cases, I discuss them with my product manager or engineering team, depending on the type of edge case.

8. ### Take breaks and exercise gratitude.

Wow!, Onboarding can be overwhelming. Trust me, I have been there several times. Take breaks, give it time to sink in. If you're new and you're not moving at the same pace as others are, it's totally fine. You're new. Take breaks. The human brain is not like a machine; don't use it like a machine. Don't beat yourself up if you don't understand something at first. A break might be just what you need.

Gratitude is pretty awesome, especially in software engineering when your emotions keep going up and down as you encounter various challenges day in and day out. Gratitude here means trying to identify what you're thankful for every day as much as you can. Be thankful that you were able to solve that problem yesterday, even if you now have another one on your table. Be grateful for the job, for having a roof over your head, and think of as many things as you can. This helps fight depression.

9. ### Ensure you can account for what you’ve done at work every day.

This always works for me. At the close of business, I always ask myself what I was able to achieve. While working, I keep in mind that I will have to account for what I did at work that day, which motivates me to engage in activities that I can account for, even though I am working from home. If I had a bug, was I able to resolve it? If not, why not? Asking why not enables me to identify if it was within my control, i.e., to reach out to teammates or escalate it or not. Most of the time, I try to make a code contribution every day to show I have improved the overall system.

10. ### Invest in sharpening your skills.

The tech space is fast paced and things evolve so fast. I keep myself up to date by taking online courses on platforms like Udemy and LinkedIn Learning, following the handles of technologies I am passionate about and leaders in that space. I also keep practicing data structures, algorithms, and whiteboard coding as it keeps me on my toes and sharpens my coding skills. You totally don't have to follow my approach, but determine what works well for you and go after it.



That's it I hope you find some points here useful. Kindly share with anyone that you think this might help. Really glad you made it to the end here. keep excelling.
